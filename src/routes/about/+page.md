Hello, I'm Jean Moirano, a french senior recently converted to web development. I'd wish to be a full stack web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, responsive websites.

My technical stack is mostly Javascript and Svelte. I have experience with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. I have also worked with React but my heart belongs to Svelte!

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, once you tried, you'll never go back!
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is a framework for building web apps. It's super fast and super easy to get started.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), a free, open-source database alternative to Firebase.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM.

### I'm looking for an open source project to join!
